# TensorflowCPP

## Getting started

### Prerequisities

You need to install Tensorflow through the following [github](https://github.com/FloopCZ/tensorflow_cc) page.
I built and installed everything as a "shared library"

## Testing

A few tests I made going through the official Tensorflow C++ [API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/extend/cc).
